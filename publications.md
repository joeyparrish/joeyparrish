- **Kinetoscope: A Sega Genesis Video Player** ・ December 2, 2024<br>
  *Kitchener-Waterloo Video Meetup, December 2024; Sydney Video Meetup, January 2025*<br>
  [Kinetoscope](https://github.com/joeyparrish/kinetoscope) is a video player, custom video format, and custom WiFi-streaming cartridge for Sega Genesis. It's what YouTube might have looked like if it had been released in 1990.<br>

- **Generative AI Codec: A Modest Proposal** ・ October 25, 2023<br>
  *Demuxed 2023*<br>
  What if captions were a video bitstream, and generative AI were the video decoder?<br>

- **UpFish: Scripted Audio Manipulation for Streaming Media** ・ October 12, 2022<br>
  *Demuxed 2022*<br>
  [UpFish](https://github.com/joeyparrish/upfish) is a Chrome extension that allows you to modify the audio of your streaming movies. It was designed to bring the DVD-era magic of "Wizard People, Dear Reader" back to life on the streaming site of your choice. (But I didn't stop there.)<br>

- **Some Nonlinear Rado Numbers** ・ April 27, 2018 ・ Co-authored with [Kellen Myers](https://www.kellenmyers.org/), lead author<br>
  *[Integers](https://math.colgate.edu/~integers/), [Volume 18B](https://math.colgate.edu/~integers/vol18b.html)*<br>
  We discuss the computation of Rado numbers for several families of nonlinear equations, including equations comprised of sums of squares, in the spirit of the recently resolved conjecture of Erdős and Graham regarding the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2. We provide (uniform) upper bounds for the 2- and 3-color Rado numbers of some such equations, as well as Rado numbers for a variety of other well-known nonlinear equations.<br>
